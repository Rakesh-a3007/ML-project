# Weather Aware Traffic Sign Recognition System-ML-project
A hybrid CNN-DNN deep learning model that recognizes traffic signs under adverse weather using both image data and real-time weather metadata.

This project presents a hybrid **CNN-DNN deep learning model** that recognizes traffic signs in real-time even under **adverse weather conditions** like fog, rain, and glare. It uses both image data and **real-time weather metadata (temperature + humidity)** via the OpenWeatherMap API.

### 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python, Keras, TensorFlow, OpenCV
- CNN-DNN hybrid architecture
- GTSRB Dataset
- Weather API (OpenWeatherMap)
- Matplotlib, NumPy, Pandas

### 📈 Results
- 🧠 Model Accuracy: **99.3%**
- 🚀 Inference Speed: **100+ FPS**
- 📊 43-class classification with weather-based augmentation
